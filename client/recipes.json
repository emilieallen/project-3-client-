Next, add the coconut sugar, almond flour, gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt and stir until well combined. The texture will be quite thick and will resemble a cookie dough more than a typical cake batter. Add the cubed apples and mix until they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.",

Next, begin adding the flour in 1/4 cup (40 g) increments, mixing well with your fork after each addition. You may need more or less flour depending on the brand of your gluten-free blend. Add flour until the texture appears pale and slightly dry and the mixture clumps together easily when you pinch it.",
      "6. At the 40-minute mark, remove the cake from the oven and carefully add the crumble topping in an even layer on top of the cake. Return the cake to the oven for 5 minutes until the crumble topping is dry to the touch and just beginning to look toasty.",
      "7. Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 10 minutes before removing from the baking dish. Let cool almost completely before slicing and serving. Keep at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month."

      "1 Tbsp avocado oil ((or olive oil))",
      "1/2 tsp sea salt",
      "1 batch Easy Vegan Chorizo",

    "recipeInstructions": [
      "1. POTATOES: Preheat oven to 425 F (218 C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Add chopped potatoes (~1/4 \u2013 3/8-inch thick) to the baking sheet and drizzle with avocado oil. Then add salt and toss well to combine. Roast until golden brown and crispy, or about 20-25 minutes. You'll know they're done when they're golden brown on the bottom and edges and tender in the center.",
      "2. CHORIZO: Prepare Easy Vegan Chorizo mixture while the potatoes are cooking. You can also use store-bought such as Soyrizo or leftover Vegan Chorizo Links (if using links, break them up into a crumble texture before cooking). To cook the chorizo (any of the options), heat a 10-inch nonstick or well-seasoned cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) avocado oil and place half of the chorizo into the skillet. Distribute evenly over the pan so it's in one thin layer. Cook for 3-4 minutes, undisturbed. It should be sizzling and popping slightly - if it's not, turn up the heat a bit. Repeat with the remaining chorizo.",
      "3. SALSA: Optionally, prepare Mango Salsa. Otherwise, use any store-bought salsa you enjoy. Other delicious homemade options include our Easy Red Salsa, Chipotle Red Salsa, or Roasted Salsa Verde.",
      "4. TORTILLAS: Warm tortillas by wrapping in a damp paper towel (or kitchen towel) and microwaving for 30 seconds \u2013 1 minute. If using fresh or homemade tortillas, you can warm them one at a time in a cast iron skillet over high heat (or on a hot grill) for 10-20 seconds on each side (or until just warmed), then wrap in a towel to keep warm until serving.",
      "5. TACOS: To the warmed tortillas, add chorizo, potatoes, salsa, and chopped avocado and enjoy!",
      "6. Best when fresh. Leftovers will keep stored separately in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. Reheat potatoes and vegan chorizo in a skillet over medium heat, adding more oil as needed to prevent sticking. Not freezer friendly."

      "3. In a food processor or blender, pulse the oats until they form a coarse flour - there should not be any whole oats visible.",
      "4. Add the beans and mushrooms to the oats and pulse a few times to break the beans and mushrooms into smaller pieces. Then add the flax eggs, chili powder, smoked paprika, cayenne (optional, start with the lesser amount), ketchup, garlic (optional), and salt and pepper. Pulse to fully combine, but avoid processing it into too smooth of a paste - leave some chunks for texture. Taste and season with more salt and pepper as needed, more paprika for smokiness, or cayenne for heat. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the chopped walnuts until fully combined.",
      "5. Scoop 2 tablespoons of the mixture and form into a mini sausage link shape. If it is too sticky, run your hands under some water and try again with slightly wet hands. Using 2 tablespoons will make ~16 sausages, or you can also use a 1/3-cup measurement to make 8 sausages about 6 inches long (amounts as recipe is written // adjust if altering number of servings).",
      "6. Once formed, place sausages on a plate lined with parchment paper and chill in the refrigerator for 20-25 minutes, until firm and not sticky to the touch.",
      "7. While your sausages chill, bring a few inches of water to a boil in a large pot with a steamer insert. Remove your sausages from the refrigerator and wrap each sausage in a small piece of parchment paper, twisting the ends to seal. Place sausages in the steamer basket and steam for 30 minutes, until firm and cooked through. Add more water at the 15-minute mark (or as needed) to avoid scorching your pot.",
      "8. If freezing for later, cool completely and transfer to the freezer. Otherwise, to cook and brown the sausages, heat a large cast iron skillet over medium heat and add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) oil to the pan. Remove the sausages from the parchment paper, add as many as will fit in the pan comfortably, and fry for 5-10 minutes, turning every once in a while until all sides are slightly browned. Repeat with more oil and sausages. You can also cook the sausages on a grill if desired!",
      "9. Enjoy these on their own or with your favorite breakfast or brunch items. They'd be especially delicious with our Southwest Tofu Scramble, Perfect Roasted Potatoes, Corn Tortillas, and Mango Habanero Hot Sauce.",
      "10. Store leftovers in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month. They can be cooked on the stovetop directly from frozen."

      "1 1/2 tsp flaxseed meal",
      "1 1/2 Tbsp water",
      "1/4 cup unsweetened dairy-free milk ((we used almond milk))",

      "1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.",
      "2. SCONES: In a small bowl, prepare the flax egg by combining flaxseed meal and water. Stir and let sit for a few minutes to gel. Then add the dairy-free milk and vanilla (optional).",
      "3. In a separate, larger mixing bowl, add almond flour, potato starch, oat flour, baking powder, cane sugar, and salt.",
      "4. Cut the cold vegan butter into cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Using a fork or pastry cutter, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until only small bits remain.",
      "5. Whisk the dairy-free milk and flax mixture one more time and add to the dry ingredients, stirring with a wooden spoon until combined.",
      "6. Next, add the diced peaches and gently stir until evenly distributed. The moisture from the peaches will bind the dough more. Using extra ripe peaches may make it more moist, while using firmer, less-ripe peaches may make it more dry. You want the dough to be evenly moist but not overly sticky. If your dough is too crumbly, add a tablespoon more dairy-free milk at a time. If it's too wet/sticky, add more almond flour a tablespoon at a time.",
      "7. Gently transfer dough to an oat or almond floured surface. Shape into a disk about 3/4 to 1 inch in height. Cut the circle into 6 wedges (or 8 for smaller scones) and gently place them onto the baking sheet, spacing them out evenly. Option to sprinkle with a bit more organic cane sugar for a bit of a sweet crust.",
      "8. Bake for 18-22 minutes until fluffy and golden on the edges. Let cool on the baking sheet before digging in.",
      "9. VANILLA GLAZE: For the optional glaze, combine sifted organic powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and dairy-free milk of choice in a mixing bowl and whisk into a pourable glaze. If too thick, add more dairy-free milk. If too thin, add more powdered sugar. Drizzle over scones once cooled. Glaze will set in 30 minutes to 1 hour.",
      "10. Enjoy as is or serve with vegan butter and a cup of tea. These are best the day of but can be reheated the next day in a toaster oven or regular oven at 350 F for a few minutes (or enjoy at room temperature). Once completely cooled, store leftovers at room temperature in a well-sealed container for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 1 month."

You don't have to remove the stem completely (we actually enjoy the top 2/3 in the salad), but be sure to compost or reserve the larger bottom stalks for DIY vegetable broth.",

      "3. Add kale to a large mixing / serving bowl and top with lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil. Then massage with clean hands for about 3 minutes. The point of massaging is to infuse the kale with the lemon juice and oil, and also to break down some of the tough, fibrous characteristics of kale. This makes it easier to chew and digest, and makes for a more tender salad. Season with salt, massage/toss once more, then set aside.",
      "4. Next prepare the dressing by adding tahini, lemon juice, maple syrup, and salt (optional) to a medium mixing bowl. Whisk to combine. Then slowly add water until creamy and pourable. The mixture may seize up and thicken at first, but continue adding water a little at a time, whisking until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lemon juice for acidity, maple syrup for sweetness, or salt to taste. Set aside. (Store leftover dressing in the refrigerator up to 5-7 days - sometimes longer.)",
      "5. To serve, top with desired amount of dressing and crispy chickpeas (optional), toss, and serve. Leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days (not freezer friendly).

Scoop 1/3 cup (80 ml) of the batter into the skillet, quickly pick up and rotate the skillet to spread the batter into a 5-7 inch circle, then turn up the heat to medium-high and cook the pancake, undisturbed, until browned on the bottom and edges, about 2-3 minutes. Use a spatula to peek at the underside of the pancake to make sure it's browned before flipping - the pancake should lift away from the pan easily; if it sticks, let it cook a bit longer. Once ready, flip and cook for 1 minute on the other side. If you are using cast iron and the batter is sticking, wipe a small amount of olive oil across the entire surface of the pan and try again. Transfer finished pancake to a plate, turn the heat back down to medium, and repeat with the remaining batter.",

      "1/4 cup creamy unsweetened almond butter ((if nut-free, sub sunflower seed butter))",

    "recipeInstructions": [
      "1. Line a standard-size loaf pan or similar-sized dish (~8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inches) with parchment paper and set aside.",
      "2. To pop the amaranth, heat a large rimmed skillet (or large saucepan) over medium-high heat. Set a medium mixing bowl to the side for the popped amaranth. Once the pan is hot (give it at least 3-5 minutes to heat up), add 1 Tbsp (10 g) unpopped amaranth and immediately cover with a lid. Shake/slide the pot back and forth over the heat (wearing oven mitts can be helpful) to move the grain around. It should start popping within 1-3 seconds and be done popping at the 10-second mark (if it's not, that means the pan isn't hot enough). Quickly empty into the mixing bowl.",
      "3. Be sure to pull the amaranth off the heat at around 10 seconds (or when the unpopped grains are turning from golden to dark brown) or the amaranth will burn. It's okay if not every single grain has popped. It may take a couple tries to dial in your heat and not burn the grains, but then you'll hit your stride!",
      "4. Continue until you have roughly 1 1/4 cup (65 g) popped grain (adjust amount if altering number of servings).",
      "5. Add 1 inch of water to a small saucepan and bring to a low boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer. Place a small glass or metal bowl over the saucepan and add the chocolate chips, almond butter, and coconut oil. Heat, stirring occasionally with a spatula or spoon, until melted and no lumps remain (~3-5 minutes). You can also melt them in a heat-proof glass bowl in the microwave in 20-second increments.",
      "6. Once melted, stir in the salt and vanilla and carefully remove from the heat. Pour the chocolate mixture into the bowl of popped amaranth and stir until it is evenly coated in chocolate.",
      "7. Transfer to the parchment-lined pan and refrigerate until set - about 1 hour. Then slice into bars - we like slicing into ~12 bars as they are rich and satisfying even as a small bar.",
      "8. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1-2 weeks or in the freezer for 1 month."

It should stick together when pressed between two fingers; if still dry and crumbly, continue processing until it is sticky enough to form into a ball. Taste and adjust as needed, adding more cardamom, orange zest, or salt to taste.",

      "2. To make the homemade components of the charcuterie board pictured above, we started by making our spicy vegan pimento cheese ball in advance and letting it chill for the minimum time suggested in the recipe (6 hours). Next we made vegan pepperoni and set it aside when it was done. Then we made charred serrano white bean dip and placed it in the refrigerator to chill. Lastly we made candied nuts and cut up the fresh fruits and veggies!",

Our favorite trick is to place stackable snacks (like cucumbers and vegan pepperoni) in curves or around the dishes. All that's left is to get your snack on!",

OPTIONAL: If you prefer warm oats, you can heat your oats in the microwave for 45-60 seconds (just ensure there's enough room at the top of your jar to allow for expansion and prevent overflow, and that it's a microwave-safe container), or transfer oats to a saucepan and heat over medium heat until warmed through. Add more liquid as needed if oats get too thick/dry.",
      "5. Overnight oats will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, though best within the first 12-24 hours. Not freezer friendly."

      "2 (20-ounce) cans jackfruit in water or brine ((NOT in syrup // we like Trader Joe's brand))",
      "2 Tbsp avocado or coconut oil ((if avoiding oil, sub water))",
      "1/2 large white or yellow onion ((thinly sliced))",
      "4 cloves garlic, minced ((optional))",
      "1/2 tsp sea salt",
      "1 Tbsp ground smoked paprika",
      "1 Tbsp ground cumin",

      "1. Thoroughly rinse and drain jackfruit. Then begin sorting. The pieces come in chunks or triangle shapes. Cut off the center 'core' portion of the jackfruit that's tougher in texture and separate it from the rest of the fruit. Then chop into smaller pieces. For the remaining portion of the jackfruit that appears more stringy, use your hands or a fork to pull into small shredded pieces. You're basically trying to get the jackfruit into small, shredded/chopped pieces. Rinse the jackfruit once more in a fine mesh strainer, drain, and thoroughly dry.",
      "2. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil of choice, onion, and garlic (optional). Sauté for 4-5 minutes or until onions are golden brown and softened.",
      "3. Add jackfruit, salt, paprika, cumin, chili powder, coconut sugar, chipotle peppers and their adobo sauce, coconut aminos, water, and lime juice (optional). Stir to coat and reduce heat to low-medium. Cover and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
      "4. Taste and adjust flavors as needed, adding more paprika or cumin for smokiness, chili powder for heat, chipotle pepper or adobo sauce for spice, coconut sugar or maple syrup for sweetness, coconut aminos for saltiness / depth of flavor, or lime for acidity.",
      "5. Turn up heat to medium-high and cook for 3-5 minutes more to get a little extra color/texture. Then remove from heat.",
      "6. Preheat the oven to 425 F (218 C) and brush a baking sheet with avocado oil. Set aside.",
      "7. Next, working in batches (~8 tortillas at a time), warm your tortillas by wrapping them in a damp kitchen towel or paper towel and microwaving for ~30-60 seconds. This ensures they are nice and pliable to prevent them from splitting open or unfolding.",
      "8. Fill the tortillas one at a time, using ~2 heaping tablespoons of the jackfruit mixture. They hold their shape best if you place the filling closer to one side and in a narrow pile (see photo). Roll gently but tightly into taquitos and place them seam side down on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat until all the filling is used. It should make ~16 taquitos.",
      "9. Spray or brush the taquitos generously with avocado oil (or another neutral oil) and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until crispy and uniformly golden brown. Watch carefully near the end to avoid burning. The undersides get more browned than the tops.",
      "10. Serve warm on their own or with refried beans, guacamole, vegan sour cream, and/or salsa verde. Leftovers will keep stored in the freezer up to 1 month.",
      "11. TO FREEZE: Let cool completely, then transfer to a freezer-safe container. Reheat by covering with a lid or paper towel and microwaving for 1-2 minutes, or until heated through to the center."

    "recipeInstructions": [
      "1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and set out a bare (or parchment-lined) baking sheet (or more as needed).",
      "2. Drain chickpeas well. If using oil, rinse well with water and thoroughly drain. If omitting oil, simply drain well and skip rinsing with water.",
      "3. Once drained well, spread the chickpeas out on a clean, absorbent towel and use your hands to gently roll and dry the chickpeas. Some of the skins should start coming off. You can opt to peel all of the chickpeas - which can help for extra crispiness! - or simply remove the skins that come off. Either way, the chickpeas will crisp up. I just found that peeling them does yield slightly crispier chickpeas.",
      "4. Transfer the chickpeas to a mixing bowl and top with oil. Mix well to combine. DO NOT add the other seasonings at this point - they can interrupt the crisping process, so wait to add until after baking.",
      "5. Bake for 45 minutes or until golden brown and dry/crispy to the touch. We like turning the pan around and shaking the chickpeas around the halfway point for even cooking. Note: Peeled chickpeas cook faster than unpeeled. If omitting oil, they will also cook faster.",
      "6. Remove your chickpeas from the oven and prepare your BBQ seasoning. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine the maple syrup, smoked paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, sea salt, black pepper, and cayenne (optional) until a paste forms.",
      "7. Pour in your still-warm chickpeas and toss gently to evenly coat them with the seasoning mixture. Place them back on the cookie sheet to cool fully and so the seasoning can dry/set.",
      "8. Enjoy as a protein-rich snack or use atop things like grain bowls, kale salads, or our easy and summery chopped salad! To store, place in a storage container or jar and DO NOT tightly cover. Instead, crack lid so they can 'breathe' a bit. This helps them stay crispy longer. These are best the first day, but they will last for 4-5 days at room temperature. Alternatively, seal well and freeze up to 1 month."

      "1. ROASTING ALMONDS: If topping your bites with almonds (optional), preheat the oven to 350 F (176 C) and place raw almonds on a small baking sheet. Place almonds in the preheated oven and bake for 8 minutes (be careful not to burn). Set aside for later use.",
      "2. BITES: To a food processor, add pitted dates and coconut flakes and pulse until well combined and only small chunks of date remain - about 1 minute.",
      "3. Add in the almond butter, cacao powder, vanilla extract, and salt. Pulse until everything is evenly combined. The mixture should be wet enough to stick together when you squeeze it but dry enough not to stick to your hands too much. If too dry, add more almond butter 1 Tbsp at a time. If too sticky, add more coconut flakes 1 Tbsp at a time.",
      "4. Scoop out 2-Tbsp amounts and use your hands to roll into balls. As original recipe is written, makes ~12 balls. Place balls on a parchment-lined plate or baking sheet and transfer to the freezer for 20 minutes, or until semi-firm to the touch.",
      "5. GLAZE: If using the optional glaze, prepare it while the bites chill. Add 1 inch of water to a small saucepan and bring to a low boil over medium heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and place the coconut butter and coconut oil in a small heat-proof bowl (we prefer glass). Carefully place the bowl on top of the saucepan with simmering water. Heat, stirring occasionally with a spatula or spoon, until melted and loose (~2 minutes). You can also melt the glaze in a heat-proof bowl in the microwave in 20-second increments until melted.",
      "6. Remove bites from the freezer. Dunk each bite into the glaze and roll around until all sides are coated. Use a fork to tap off excess glaze, then transfer back to your parchment-lined plate or baking sheet. To reduce pooling, you can place glazed bites on a cooling rack set over the parchment-lined dish.",
      "7. If there's any leftover glaze, either chill once more then coat again, or pour extra glaze into a silicone mold or cupcake liner, chill, and enjoy as a treat.",
      "8. Once all balls are glazed, option to place a roasted almond on each ball while the glaze is still wet. Leave them to set at room temperature or place in the refrigerator for at least 10 minutes to harden faster.",
      "9. Enjoy right away or whenever you need a quick snack! Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 1 month. Note that the coconut glaze can get soft at warm temperatures."

      "5. Once hot, add a little avocado oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan (we used ~1/2 Tbsp // use more for a crispier effect). Add enough fritters to comfortably fit without crowding. Pan fry until golden brown - ~3-4 minutes on each side.",

      "3. Add in the oat flour, arrowroot starch, and ground flax seeds and mix with a wooden spoon until the flour is completely incorporated. Your dough should not feel too tacky (sticking to your hands) or too dry (crumbly), but should hold its form. If the dough appears too dry, it likely just needs more mixing. If it feels sticky, it needs more oat flour.",
      "4. Place a sheet of parchment paper on a large cutting board or countertop. Place dough in the center and then place another sheet of parchment paper on top of the dough. Working from the center out, roll the dough into a large rectangle (~10 x 12 inches) about 1/16-inch thick. Rolling to this thickness makes these crackers crispy (our preferred texture) rather than soft. If you have any difficulty rolling the dough, place it in the fridge to chill for 10-20 minutes and then try again.",
      "5. Use a pizza cutter or knife to cut the dough into 2-inch x 3-inch rectangles (keep in mind they will expand slightly during baking). Then use a metal spatula lightly floured with oat flour to transfer to a baking sheet. If you have a hard time transferring or handling, pop in the refrigerator to chill for 5-10 minutes. Space crackers ~1 inch apart to allow for spreading.",
      "6. Continue rolling out and cutting remaining dough until you have used it all up. Prick each graham cracker twice with a fork. Recipe as written makes ~15 crackers (will vary based on how thinly they are rolled and whether modifying batch size).",
      "7. Bake for 10-14 minutes or until slightly firm and darker in color. Watch closely near the end to avoid burning.",
      "8. Let cool for 5-10 minutes on the baking sheet, then gently transfer to a cooling rack. Enjoy plain, make s'mores, or try our graham cracker crust!",
      "9. Once completely cooled, crackers can be stored in an airtight container for up to 2-3 days at room temperature, 7-10 days in the fridge, or 1-2 months in the freezer. Dough can also be frozen for up to 1 month and rolled/baked after defrosting in the fridge overnight."

      "1. In a medium mixing bowl add light coconut milk, olive oil, and apple cider vinegar and whisk to combine.",

      "3. Next, add coconut flour, oat flour, and potato starch and stir with a wooden spoon to combine. Let rest 5 minutes uncovered.",
      "4. At this point you should have a dough that is malleable and very slightly tacky but doesn't stick to your hands. The dough should start pulling away from the sides of the bowl when the right amount of moisture is achieved, and it shouldn't be crumbly at all. Add a bit more of each flour until you reach the right consistency.",
      "5. Scoop out 1 ball of dough (~3 Tbsp in size) and place between two pieces of parchment paper. Use a rolling pin to roll into a thin oval shape slightly larger than 1/8-inch thick. For fluffier, thicker flatbread roll to slightly less than 1/4-inch thick and cook slightly longer. NOTE: If sticking or too tacky, add a light dusting of GF flour to the dough while rolling out (optional - shouldn&#039;t be necessary).",

If it cracks at all, just carefully and quickly patch back together with your hands (be careful not to touch the hot skillet).",
      "7. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until the underside is golden brown. Bubbles may form while it's cooking - that's normal and good. Flip carefully and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Lower heat as needed to ensure it doesn't burn. You'll know it's done when both sides are golden brown.",
      "8. Repeat this process until all dough is used (~6 large or 10-12 mini flatbreads as the original recipe is written).",
      "9. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator or at room temperature for up to 2-3 days. To freeze, place cooked, cooled flatbread in a freezer-safe container or bag (adding parchment paper between each flatbread will prevent sticking) and freeze for up to 1 month. As with most bread, best when fresh.",

Boil celeriac for 8-9 minutes, or until fork tender. Carefully remove and place on a cooling rack or a plate to dry and cool slightly.",
      "2. CHIPS: If you want to enjoy your fish with 'chips' (fries), start preparing your choice of Perfect Roasted Potatoes, Baked Garlic Matchstick Fries, or Crispy Cajun Baked Fries (Oil-Free!) while your celeriac boils.",
      "3. BATTER: In a medium mixing bowl, combine gluten-free flour, salt, and nori flakes (optional for 'sea' flavor) and whisk to combine. Add sparkling water (starting with the lesser amount) and whisk until smooth and no lumps remain. Let the batter rest for 5 minutes to thicken slightly. After resting, it should be similar to pancake batter in texture (see photo) - add more water to thin or flour to thicken.",
      "4. In a large rimmed skillet (we prefer cast iron), large pot, or Dutch oven, heat the avocado oil over medium-high heat. Using your fingers or a fork, dunk each boiled celeriac strip into the batter - you want them thickly and evenly coated. Carefully transfer the battered strips to the hot avocado oil. Each piece should sizzle nicely when you place it in the oil - if it doesn't make any sound, turn up the heat slightly. Continue dunking and adding the strips to the skillet until the skillet is full. Once sizzling, cook each strip for ~3-4 minutes on the first side.",
      "5. Then use tongs or a metal spatula to carefully lift and flip the strips - they should come up easily. If they are sticking badly they likely haven't cooked long enough. Cook for 2-3 minutes on the second side, or until lightly browned. Transfer the fried pieces to a cooling rack or a plate with a napkin to drain excess oil, then dunk and fry any remaining celeriac strips that didn't fit in the skillet. Set aside until cool enough to handle.",
      "6. Meanwhile, prepare a batch of Easy Vegan Tartar Sauce (or use store-bought), remove your chips/fries from the oven, and enjoy the fish and fries dunked in tartar sauce!",
      "7. Best when fresh. We tested freezing and reheating the &quot;fish&quot; and it crisps back up nicely, but the celeriac flavor is stronger and the crispy coating pulls away from the celeriac a bit. Reheat from frozen by baking on a greased baking sheet at 400 F (204 C) for 10-15 minutes, flipping at the halfway point."

Then slice into 1/4-inch slices.",

You can also put half of the soup in a high-speed heat-proof blender, blend until smooth, and add it back to the rest of the soup. We like our soup a little rustic and brothy with pieces of potato, but you can also purée it until completely smooth if preferred.",

Place 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of avocado oil and the sliced yellow onion in a large heavy-bottomed skillet (like a large cast iron pan or Dutch oven) and turn it to medium-low heat. Stir constantly and sauté until the onions begin to turn translucent, then turn the heat down to low.

      "6. Add the oat flour (starting with the lesser amount), salt and pepper, miso paste, coconut aminos, and smoked paprika, and pulse a few times to combine. Add the cashew crumble and pulse once or twice to distribute the cashews without overmixing. The mixture should be thick and sticky, but easy to form into patties. If too wet, add more oat flour and stir by hand. Taste and adjust, as needed, adding more salt to taste.",
      "7. Using a 1/2-cup measuring cup, scoop your burger mixture and form into 4 even patties.

      "4 cloves garlic, minced",
      "3 stalks green onion, thinly sliced",
      "2 1/2 Tbsp minced fresh ginger",
      "1 1/2 - 2 Tbsp tamari ((or low-sodium soy sauce if not gluten-free // if soy-free, sub coconut aminos))",

      "1. If you haven't done so, cook quinoa and set aside to cool. To prepare 1 cup cooked quinoa: Add 1/3 heaping cup (65 g) dry quinoa to a small saucepan and toast for 2-3 minutes over medium heat. Then add 2/3 cup (160 ml) water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, cover and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for 10-15 minutes or until water is absorbed. Then fluff with a fork, remove from the heat, and crack the lid so the quinoa can cool.",
      "2. Heat a large skillet over medium heat with the sesame oil. Once hot, add the mushrooms and sauté for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are lightly browned and have released most of their moisture.",
      "3. Drain and rinse the black beans, then dry in a clean kitchen towel.",
      "4. To the sautéed mushrooms, add the black beans, garlic, green onion, ginger, and tamari (or soy sauce or coconut aminos). Sauté for 3-4 minutes, or until slightly softened, stirring frequently. Set aside to cool slightly.",

      "6. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and pulse until no large pieces of beans or mushrooms remain, being careful not to overmix into a paste.",
      "7. Add 1 cup (185 g) cooked and cooled quinoa (adjust amount if altering batch size) and the maple syrup (or agave or honey). Pulse to combine until a textured dough forms, again being careful not to overmix.",
      "8. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more tamari for saltiness/depth of flavor, sesame oil for nuttiness, or maple syrup for balance. If it's too wet, add more quinoa and pulse to combine.",
      "9. Scoop out 1 1/2-Tbsp portions of dough and gently shape into round balls using wet hands. Recipe as written makes ~15 meatballs. Add formed meatballs to a bare or parchment-lined baking sheet.",
      "10. Bake for 15 minutes. Then flip to ensure even baking and bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until golden brown and slightly dry to the touch.",
      "11. These &quot;meatballs&quot; are delicious served with steamed or roasted broccoli, sesame seeds, teriyaki sauce, and your grain of choice (brown rice, white rice, quinoa, coconut rice, millet // or cauliflower rice for grain-free).",
      "12. Leftovers will keep up to 3-4 days in the refrigerator or 1 month in the freezer. To reheat cooked meatballs from frozen, place on a baking sheet and bake at 400 F (200 C) for 10-12 minutes."

Adjust if needed, adding more curry paste for curry flavor, ginger for freshness and zing, coconut aminos for saltiness, serrano for heat, maple syrup for sweetness, or lemon or lime juice for brightness (you'll likely need the lemon/lime if using store-bought curry paste but not if using homemade).",
      "4. Cover and simmer until the vegetables are fork tender - about 5-10 minutes. Then stir in the cubed salmon and chopped kale (or collard greens or spinach // optional), reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer gently until just cooked through - about 5 minutes.

      "1 small butternut squash ((1 small squash yields ~2 cups or 480 g purée))",
      "10-12 cloves garlic, peeled and left whole",

      "1. Preheat oven to 425 F (218 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Slice your squash in half lengthwise and remove the seeds, but leave the skin on. Rub squash flesh with a bit of oil. Place garlic cloves on the prepared baking sheet and top with squash cut side down (the scooped-out squash should cover the garlic so it doesn't burn). Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the skin is blistered and golden brown and a knife inserted into the squash comes out very easily.",
      "2. While the squash is cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles in the salted water according to package instructions or until al dente. Then drain, set aside, and gently toss with a little olive oil to prevent the noodles from sticking together.",
      "3. Heat a large rimmed skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the olive oil and onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes or until softened, then add the mushrooms and sauté another 5-7 minutes or until lightly browned. Then add kale, salt, pepper, and thyme (optional) and sauté for another 5-7 minutes or until tender.",
      "4. Once the squash is tender and cool enough to handle, scoop 2 cups (~480 g) roasted squash (adjust amount if altering number of servings) into a high-speed blender. Add roasted garlic cloves, cashews, lemon juice, salt, nutritional yeast (optional), and water and blend until smooth, adding more water and scraping down the sides of the blender as needed. It should be thick, creamy, and scoopable. Taste and adjust as needed, adding more salt for overall flavor, lemon for brightness, garlic for savory flavor, or nutritional yeast for cheesiness.",
      "5. Reduce oven temperature to 350 F (177 C).",
      "6. Assemble the lasagna in a 9 x 13 (or similar size) glass or ceramic baking dish. Add 1/2 cup (120 ml) sauce to the bottom of the pan and spread it evenly. Then add a layer of noodles followed by 1/3 of the filling. Repeat with two more layers of sauce, noodles, and filling. Then finish with a layer of noodles and the remaining sauce as the top layer (it should be a thicker layer fully coating the noodles).",
      "7. Bake lasagna at 350 F (177 C) for 30 minutes or until the top layer is slightly dry and a little darker in color.",
      "8. Carefully remove from the oven and let cool 5-10 minutes before serving. Then slice, serve, and enjoy. We recommend garnishing with freshly chopped basil and vegan parmesan cheese. See notes below for freezing instructions."
