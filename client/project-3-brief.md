# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #3: Simply Good Food (a MERN Stack App)

## Overview

**Building upon Project 2, we built the backend for this project.** 

**We built a full-stack application** by making our own backend and our own front-end.
Simply Good Food is a clone of the website Minimalist Baker. 

**Focus:** Our group focused on simple stable code and tried to not wander too much into the weeds of super advanced functionality. 

To this end, we planned something manageable with a clear MVP and clear stretch goals.
We were asked to focus on quality, not quantity, so as a group of two people (with day jobs), this is what drove our decision making. 

We needed to be able to **accomplish something in the two weeks (30 class hrs)** we had. Also, compared to the other groups, we were a group of 2 and not a group of 3.

## Technical Requirements

What we did:

- **Built a full-stack application** by making our own backend and our own front-end
- **Used an Express API** to serve our data from a Mongo database 
- **Built a front-end that consumes our API** built with React and using the React-Bootstrap styling library
- **It's a complete product** indivividuals are able to log in and leave a comment on recipes that they like. 
- **Implemented thoughtful user wireframes** => We spent a decent amount of time on our planning and had clear stretch goals indicated in the wireframes. 
- **Developed a visually impressive design** => We went for a fresh, minimalist approach, so not a lot of customizing with Bootstrap, but we looked at a few Squarespace designs and decided that less is more. 
- **Deployed the app online** => Our app is publically accessible.

## Necessary Deliverables

- A **working app** hosted on the internet: 
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
- A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project


- **A `readme.md` file** with:
  - An embedded screenshot of the app

  - Explanations of the **technologies** used
  - 
  - A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**

    
  - **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
     Bootstrap-React
     React-router-dom

  - Link to your **user stories/wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
     
    
  - Link to your **pitch deck/presentation** – documentation of your wireframes, user stories, and proposed architecture

  - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
- **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
- **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
- **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
- **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
- **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
- **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
- **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
- **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
- **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
